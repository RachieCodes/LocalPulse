## 🗑️ Database Management - City Search Issue Fix

### 🔍 Problem Identified
City search results were persisting after data clearing operations because:

1. **Multiple Data Sources**: The system has different data sources:
   - `manual` - Sample data created by scripts
   - `google_places` - Real data from Google Places API  
   - `city_search` - Results from city search functionality

2. **Incomplete Clearing**: Previous clearing operations only targeted specific sources, leaving "city_search" data untouched.

3. **Cached Results**: Streamlit cache and session state weren't being fully cleared.

### ✅ Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **Enhanced Cache Clearing**
- Added `_clear_cached_session_state()` method
- Clears all relevant session state variables that might cache search results
- Added to all data clearing operations

#### 2. **Comprehensive Source Management**
- **Clear by Source**: Individual buttons for each data source
- **Clear All Sources**: New button that clears ALL data sources at once
- **Visual Source Display**: Shows metrics for each data source

#### 3. **Improved User Interface**
- **Data by Source Section**: Shows real-time counts for each source type
- **Four-Column Layout**: 
  - 🧪 Sample Data (manual)
  - 🌐 Google Places (google_places) 
  - 🔍 City Search (city_search)
  - 🧹 All Sources (comprehensive clearing)

#### 4. **Session State Management**
Clears these cached variables on data operations:
- `search_results`
- `city_search_results`
- `last_search_query`
- `cached_businesses`
- `cached_categories`
- `cached_cities`
- `business_data_cache`
- `review_data_cache`

### 🎯 How to Test the Fix

1. **Search for businesses** in a city using the city search feature
2. **Verify data exists** in the Database Manager tab (should show "city_search" entries)
3. **Clear city search data** using the "🗑️ Clear Search" button
4. **Confirm removal** - the search entries should be gone
5. **Alternative**: Use "🧹 Clear All Sources" to remove everything at once

### 🛡️ Safety Features
- **Real-time counts** - Always shows current data counts before clearing
- **Source separation** - Clear only what you want to remove
- **Session state reset** - Ensures UI reflects actual database state
- **Cache invalidation** - Forces fresh data loading after clearing

### 📱 User Experience
- **Immediate feedback** - Success/error messages for all operations
- **Automatic refresh** - UI updates immediately after data operations
- **Clear organization** - Easy to understand what each button does
- **Visual metrics** - See exactly what data exists before removing

The city search persistence issue is now completely resolved! 🎉
